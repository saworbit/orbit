## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Orbit, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report security issues privately:

1. **Email:** Send details to **shaneawall@gmail.com**
2. **Subject Line:** Include "[SECURITY]" in the subject
3. **Include:**
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
   - Your contact information

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline:** Varies by severity (see below)

### 🎯 Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, data loss | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, authentication bypass | 7 days |
| **Medium** | Information disclosure, DoS | 14 days |
| **Low** | Minor issues with limited impact | 30 days |

## Security Features in Orbit

### ✅ Built-in Security

- **SHA-256 Checksums** - Verify file integrity on all transfers
- **Memory Safety** - Written in Rust with no unsafe code in core operations
- **Audit Logging** - All operations logged with timestamps and checksums
- **No Network Code in Core** - File operations isolated from network concerns

### ⚠️ Security Considerations

**Current Limitations:**

1. **No Encryption in Transit**
   - Data is not encrypted during transfer
   - **Mitigation:** Use VPN, SSH tunnels, or wait for v0.5.0 encryption support

2. **Credentials in URIs**
   - URIs with passwords appear in logs and command history
   - **Mitigation:** Use environment variables (coming in v0.4.1)

3. **Audit Logs May Contain Sensitive Paths**
   - File paths are logged in audit files
   - **Mitigation:** Restrict audit log access, sanitize before sharing

4. **SMB Protocol (v0.4.0)**
   - Experimental implementation, not security-hardened
   - **Mitigation:** Do not use in production until v0.4.1

---

## Best Practices for Secure Usage

### 1. Avoid Credentials in Commands

**❌ Bad:**
```bash
orbit -s smb://admin:password123@server/share/file.txt -d ./file.txt
```

**✅ Good (coming in v0.4.1):**
```bash
export ORBIT_SMB_USER=admin
export ORBIT_SMB_PASSWORD=password123
orbit -s smb://server/share/file.txt -d ./file.txt
```

### 2. Protect Audit Logs

```bash
# Set restrictive permissions on audit logs
chmod 600 ~/.orbit/audit.log

# Use a secure location
orbit -s source -d dest --audit-log /var/log/orbit/audit.log
```

### 3. Verify Checksums

Always enable checksum verification (default):
```bash
orbit -s source.txt -d dest.txt
# Checksum automatically verified
```

Disable only if you trust the environment:
```bash
orbit -s source.txt -d dest.txt --no-verify
```

### 4. Use Secure Protocols

For network transfers:
```bash
# Use VPN or SSH tunnel
ssh -L 445:fileserver:445 jumphost
orbit -s smb://localhost/share/file.txt -d ./file.txt
```

### 5. Review Configuration Files

```bash
# Check for sensitive data in config
cat ~/.orbit/orbit.toml

# Ensure proper permissions
chmod 600 ~/.orbit/orbit.toml
```

## Disclosure Policy

When a security issue is reported:

1. **Acknowledgment:** We confirm receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation:** We assess severity and develop a fix
3. **Fix Development:** We create and test a patch
4. **Coordinated Disclosure:**
   - We notify the reporter when fix is ready
   - We publish security advisory
   - We release patched version
   - Reporter receives credit (unless requested otherwise)

### Public Disclosure Timeline

- **Critical/High:** 30 days after fix release
- **Medium:** 60 days after fix release
- **Low:** 90 days after fix release

**Exception:** If a vulnerability is already public or actively exploited, we accelerate disclosure.
