## 🔑 Key Features

### 🔄 Error Handling & Retries: Never Give Up

**NEW in v0.4.1!** Intelligent error handling with retry logic and comprehensive diagnostics.

**Features:**
- **Smart Retry Logic** — Exponential backoff with jitter to avoid thundering herd
- **Error Classification** — Distinguishes transient (retry-worthy) from fatal errors
- **Flexible Error Modes** — Abort, Skip, or Partial (keep incomplete files for resume)
- **Default Statistics Tracking** — Retry metrics (attempts, successes, failures) are collected and emitted automatically during copy operations
- **Structured Logging** — Tracing integration for detailed diagnostics

**Default Retry Metrics:**

Retry metrics are now collected and emitted by default for all `copy_file` operations, enhancing observability for data migration, transport, and storage workflows. When retries or failures occur, you'll see output like:

```
[orbit] Retry metrics: 2 retries, 1 successful, 0 failed, 0 skipped
```

Control emission with the `ORBIT_STATS` environment variable:
- `ORBIT_STATS=off` — Disable default emission (for high-volume transfers)
- `ORBIT_STATS=verbose` — Always emit, even for successful operations with no retries

**Error Modes:**
- **Abort** (default) — Stop on first error for maximum safety
- **Skip** — Skip failed files, continue with remaining files
- **Partial** — Keep partial files and retry, perfect for unstable networks

**Smart Retry Logic (NEW):**
- ⚡ **Permanent errors fail fast** — `PermissionDenied`, `AlreadyExists` skip retries (saves 35+ seconds per error)
- 🔄 **Transient errors retry** — `TimedOut`, `ConnectionRefused` use full exponential backoff
- 🎯 **Intelligent classification** — Allow-list approach ensures only truly transient errors are retried

```bash
# Resilient transfer with retries and logging
orbit --source /data --dest /backup --recursive \
      --retry-attempts 5 \
      --exponential-backoff \
      --error-mode partial \
      --log-level debug \
      --log /var/log/orbit.log

# Quick skip mode for batch operations
orbit -s /source -d /dest -R \
      --error-mode skip \
      --verbose

# Disable stats emission for high-volume batch transfers
ORBIT_STATS=off orbit --source /data --dest /backup --recursive
```

**Programmatic Statistics Tracking:**

For aggregated metrics across batch operations, pass a custom `OperationStats` instance:

```rust
use orbit::{CopyConfig, OperationStats, copy_file_with_stats};

// For aggregated stats across multiple files:
let stats = OperationStats::new();
for file in &files {
    copy_file_with_stats(&file.src, &file.dest, &config, Some(&stats))?;
}
stats.emit(); // Emit once after all operations

// Get detailed snapshot for programmatic access
let snapshot = stats.snapshot();
println!("Success rate: {:.1}%", snapshot.success_rate());
println!("Total retries: {}", snapshot.total_retries);
```

**Error Categories Tracked:**
- Validation (path errors)
- I/O operations
- Network/protocol issues
- Resource constraints (disk, memory)
- Data integrity (checksums)
- And 11 more categories for comprehensive diagnostics

### 🛡️ Disk Guardian: Pre-Flight Safety

**NEW in v0.4.1!** Comprehensive disk space and filesystem validation to prevent mid-transfer failures.

**Prevents:**
- ❌ Mid-transfer disk-full errors
- ❌ OOM conditions from insufficient space
- ❌ Transfers to read-only filesystems
- ❌ Permission errors (detected early)

**Features:**
- **Safety Margins** — 10% extra space by default, fully configurable
- **Minimum Free Space** — Always leaves 100 MB free (configurable)
- **Filesystem Integrity** — Write permissions, read-only detection
- **Staging Areas** — Atomic transfers with temporary staging
- **Live Monitoring** — Optional filesystem watching (via `notify` crate)
- **Directory Estimation** — Pre-calculate space needed for directory transfers

```bash
# Automatic pre-flight checks for directory transfers
orbit --source /data --dest /backup --recursive
# Output:
# Performing pre-flight checks...
# Estimated transfer size: 5368709120 bytes
# ✓ Sufficient disk space (with safety margin)
```

**Manual API:**
```rust
use orbit::core::disk_guardian::{ensure_transfer_safety, GuardianConfig};

let config = GuardianConfig {
    safety_margin_percent: 0.10,      // 10% extra
    min_free_space: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100 MB
    check_integrity: true,
    enable_watching: false,
};

ensure_transfer_safety(dest_path, required_bytes, &config)?;
```

**Try it:**
```bash
cargo run --example disk_guardian_demo
```

### 🛰️ Guidance System: The "Flight Computer"

**NEW in v0.5.0!** Automatic configuration validation and optimization that ensures safe, performant transfers.

**What It Does:**
The Guidance System acts as an intelligent pre-processor, analyzing your configuration for logical conflicts and automatically resolving them before execution begins. Think of it as a co-pilot that prevents common mistakes and optimizes settings based on hardware capabilities and use-case logic.

**Key Benefits:**
- 🔒 **Safety First** — Prevents data corruption from incompatible flag combinations
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization** — Automatically selects the fastest valid strategy
- 🎓 **Educational** — Explains why configurations were changed
- 🤖 **Automatic** — No manual debugging of conflicting flags

**Example Output:**
```
┌── 🛰️  Orbit Guidance System ───────────────────────┐
│ 🚀 Strategy: Disabling zero-copy to allow streaming checksum verification
│ 🛡️  Safety: Disabling resume capability to prevent compressed stream corruption
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implemented Rules:**

| Rule | Conflict | Resolution | Icon |
|------|----------|------------|------|
| **Hardware** | Zero-copy on unsupported OS | Disable zero-copy | ⚠️ |
| **Strategy** | Zero-copy + Checksum | Disable zero-copy (streaming is faster) | 🚀 |
| **Integrity** | Resume + Checksum | Disable checksum (can't verify partial file) | 🛡️ |
| **Safety** | Resume + Compression | Disable resume (can't append to streams) | 🛡️ |
| **Precision** | Zero-copy + Resume | Disable zero-copy (need byte-level seeking) | 🚀 |
| **Visibility** | Manifest + Zero-copy | Disable zero-copy (need content inspection) | 🚀 |
| **Logic** | Delta + Zero-copy | Disable zero-copy (need patch logic) | 🚀 |
| **Control** | macOS + Bandwidth + Zero-copy | Disable zero-copy (can't throttle fcopyfile) | ⚠️ |
| **UX** | Parallel + Progress bars | Info notice (visual artifacts possible) | ℹ️ |
| **Performance** | Sync + Checksum mode | Info notice (forces dual reads) | ℹ️ |
| **Physics** | Compression + Encryption | Placeholder (encrypted data won't compress) | 🚀 |

**Philosophy:**
> Users express **intent**. Orbit ensures **technical correctness**.

Rather than failing with cryptic errors, Orbit understands what you're trying to achieve and automatically adjusts settings to make it work safely and efficiently.

**Programmatic API:**
```rust
use orbit::core::guidance::Guidance;

let mut config = CopyConfig::default();
config.use_zero_copy = true;
config.verify_checksum = true;

// Run guidance pass
let flight_plan = Guidance::plan(config)?;

// Display notices
for notice in &flight_plan.notices {
    println!("{}", notice);
}

// Use optimized config
copy_file(&source, &dest, &flight_plan.config)?;
```

    // Load chunks from manifest
    let manifest = toml::from_str(r#"
        [[chunks]]
        id = 1
        checksum = "abc123"
    "#)?;

    store.init_from_manifest(42, &manifest).await?;

    // Process with automatic deduplication
    while let Some(chunk) = store.claim_pending(42).await? {
        // Do work... (if crash happens, chunk auto-reverts to pending)
        store.mark_status(42, chunk.chunk, JobStatus::Done, None).await?;
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Try it:**
```bash

### 🏷️ Metadata Preservation & Transformation

**NEW in v0.4.1!** Comprehensive file metadata preservation with transformation capabilities for cross-platform transfers and reproducible builds.

**Default Metadata Support:**
- **Timestamps** — Access time (atime), modification time (mtime), creation time (ctime)
- **Permissions** — Unix mode bits, Windows file attributes

**Extended Metadata Support** (requires `extended-metadata` feature):
- **Ownership** — User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) on Unix systems
- **Extended Attributes (xattrs)** — User-defined metadata on supported filesystems

To enable extended metadata preservation:
```toml
[dependencies]
orbit = { version = "0.5.0", features = ["extended-metadata"] }
```

> **Note:** Extended attributes have platform limitations (e.g., partial or no support on Windows, requires compatible filesystem on Unix). Ownership preservation typically requires root/administrator privileges.

**Features:**
- **Selective Preservation** — Choose exactly what to preserve: `times,perms,owners,xattrs`
- **Path Transformations** — Regex-based renaming with sed-like syntax: `s/old/new/`
- **Case Conversion** — Lowercase, uppercase, or titlecase filename normalization
- **Metadata Filtering** — Strip ownership, permissions, or xattrs for privacy/portability
- **Cross-Platform** — Graceful fallbacks on unsupported platforms
- **Backend Integration** — Works with local, SSH, S3 (extensible)
- **Strict Mode** — Configurable error handling (warn vs. fail)
- **Verification** — Post-transfer metadata validation

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Cross-platform migrations (Unix → Windows, macOS → Linux)
- ✅ Reproducible builds (normalize timestamps, strip metadata)
- ✅ Privacy-aware backups (strip ownership information)
- ✅ Cloud storage with metadata (preserve via manifest integration)
- ✅ Archival compliance (preserve extended attributes, ACLs)

```bash
# Basic metadata preservation
orbit --source /data --dest /backup --recursive --preserve-metadata

# Selective preservation with detailed flags
orbit --source /data --dest /backup \
  --preserve=times,perms,owners,xattrs \
  --verify-metadata

# With path transformations
orbit --source /photos --dest /archive \
  --preserve=all \
  --transform="rename:s/IMG_/photo_/,case:lower"

# Strip sensitive metadata for cloud
orbit --source /data --dest s3://bucket/data \
  --preserve=times,perms \
  --transform="strip:ownership,strip:xattrs"

# Strict mode (fail on any metadata error)
orbit --source /critical --dest /backup \
  --preserve=all \
  --strict-metadata
```

**Preservation Flags:**
- `times` — Access and modification timestamps (default)
- `perms` — Unix permissions (mode bits) (default)
- `owners` — User and group ownership (UID/GID) (requires privileges)
- `xattrs` — Extended attributes (requires `extended-metadata` feature, Unix-like systems only)
- `all` — Preserve everything (full support requires `extended-metadata` feature)

**Transformation Options:**
- `rename:pattern=replacement` — Regex-based path renaming
- `case:lower|upper|title` — Filename case conversion
- `strip:xattrs|ownership|permissions` — Remove metadata
- `normalize:timestamps` — Set all timestamps to epoch (reproducible builds)

📖 **API Documentation:** See `src/core/file_metadata.rs`, `src/core/transform.rs`, and `src/core/metadata_ops.rs`

- **Content-Defined Chunking (CDC)** — Gear Hash CDC solves the "shift problem" with 99.1% chunk preservation
- **Semantic Prioritization** — Intelligent file classification with 4-tier priority system for optimized disaster recovery
  - **Critical(0)**: Configs (.toml, .json, .yaml, .lock) → AtomicReplace strategy
  - **High(10)**: WAL files (pg_wal/*, *.wal, *.binlog) → AppendOnly strategy
  - **Normal(50)**: Source code, documents → ContentDefined strategy
  - **Low(100)**: Media, archives, disk images (.iso, .zip, .mp4) → ContentDefined strategy
  - **Extensible**: Custom adapters via `SemanticAdapter` trait
- **Global Deduplication** — Identical chunks stored once, regardless of file location
- **Universe Map** — Repository-wide content-addressed index for cross-file deduplication
- **100% Rename Detection** — Renaming a file results in 0 bytes transferred
- **Smart Sync Mode** — Priority-ordered transfers using BinaryHeap for semantic-aware replication
  - Automatically detects when `check_mode_str = "smart"` is configured
  - 3-phase algorithm: Scan → Analyze → Queue → Execute in priority order
  - Ensures critical files (configs) are transferred before low-priority files (backups, media)
  - ~60% faster disaster recovery via semantic prioritization
- **Persistent Universe** — ACID-compliant embedded database for chunk index persistence (Stage 4)
  - Uses redb for zero-copy, memory-mapped storage with full ACID guarantees
  - Data survives application restarts (verified with drop & re-open tests)
  - ChunkLocation tracking: Full path + offset + length for precise deduplication
  - 4/4 persistence tests passing
- **See:** [ORBIT_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md](ORBIT_V2_ARCHITECTURE.md) for complete details

**V2 CDC Features:**
- **Gear Hash Rolling Hash** — 256-entry lookup table for fast boundary detection (~2GB/s per core)
- **Shift-Resilient** — Inserting 1 byte preserves 99.1% of chunks (vs 0% with fixed-size blocks)
- **Variable Chunks** — 8KB min, 64KB avg, 256KB max (configurable)
- **BLAKE3 Hashing** — Cryptographically secure content identification
- **Iterator-Based API** — Memory-efficient streaming with `ChunkStream<R: Read>`
- **Threshold-Based Cuts** — Robust chunking across different data patterns

- **Rolling Checksum** — Gear64 (default, 64-bit) or Adler-32 (legacy, 32-bit)
- **Slice & Emit Buffering** — Non-matching spans flush as slices (no per-byte allocations) for much faster 0% similarity workloads
- **Parallel Hashing** — Rayon-based concurrent block processing
- **Smart Fallback** — Automatic full copy for incompatible files
- **80-99% Savings** — For files with minor changes
- **Configurable Blocks** — 64KB to 4MB block sizes
- **Resume Handling** — Partial manifest support for interrupted transfers (NEW!)

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Daily database backups (90-95% savings)
- ✅ VM image updates (85-95% savings)
- ✅ Large file synchronization over slow links
- ✅ Log file rotation (95-99% savings for append-only)
- ✅ Fault-tolerant transfers over unreliable networks (NEW!)

```bash
# Basic delta transfer
orbit --source bigfile.iso --dest bigfile.iso --check delta

# Recursive sync with custom block size
orbit --source /data --dest /backup --recursive \
  --check delta --block-size 512

# With resume for large files
orbit --source vm.qcow2 --dest backup/vm.qcow2 \
  --check delta --resume --block-size 2048
```

**Delta Resume Handling (NEW!):**

Delta transfers now support resume capability via partial manifests for fault-tolerant operations. On failure, a `{dest}.delta.partial.json` manifest is saved; subsequent calls will resume if possible.

```rust
use orbit::{CopyConfig, copy_file};
use orbit::core::delta::CheckMode;

let mut config = CopyConfig::default();
config.check_mode = CheckMode::Delta;
config.delta_resume_enabled = true;  // Enabled by default
config.delta_chunk_size = 1024 * 1024;  // 1MB chunks

// Attempts delta with resume; falls back on non-resumable errors
copy_file(&src, &dest, &config)?;
```

For large data migrations, enable retries at higher levels to leverage resumes. Disable resume with `config.delta_resume_enabled = false` if not needed.

**Manifest Generation (NEW!):**

When `update_manifest` is enabled and a `manifest_path` is provided, Orbit will emit or update a manifest database post-transfer, tracking file metadata and checksums. Use `ignore_existing` to skip updates if the manifest already exists.

```rust
use orbit::core::delta::{DeltaConfig, copy_with_delta_fallback, ManifestDb};
use std::path::PathBuf;

let mut config = DeltaConfig::default();
config.update_manifest = true;
config.manifest_path = Some(PathBuf::from("transfer_manifest.json"));
config.ignore_existing = false;  // Update existing manifest (default)

// Delta transfer with automatic manifest update
let (stats, checksum) = copy_with_delta_fallback(&src, &dest, &config)?;

if stats.manifest_updated {
    println!("Manifest updated with checksum: {:?}", checksum);
}

// Load manifest for custom analytics or auditing
let manifest = ManifestDb::load(&PathBuf::from("transfer_manifest.json"))?;
for (path, entry) in manifest.iter() {
    println!("{}: {} bytes, delta_used={}", path.display(), entry.size, entry.delta_used);
}
```

**Manifest Features:**
- **Automatic Updates** — Manifests are updated after successful delta or fallback transfers
- **Entry Tracking** — Each file entry includes source path, destination path, checksum, size, modification time, and delta statistics

### 🎯 Inclusion/Exclusion Filters: Selective Transfers

**NEW in v0.4.1!** Powerful rsync/rclone-inspired filter system for selective file processing with glob patterns, regex, and exact path matching.

**Features:**
- **Multiple Pattern Types** — Glob (`*.txt`, `target/**`), Regex (`^src/.*\.rs$`), Exact paths
- **Include/Exclude Rules** — Both supported with first-match-wins semantics
- **Filter Files** — Load reusable filter rules from `.orbitfilter` files
- **Early Directory Pruning** — Skip entire directory trees efficiently
- **Cross-Platform** — Consistent path matching across Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Dry-Run Visibility** — See what would be filtered before actual transfer
- **Negation Support** — Invert filter actions with `!` prefix

**Use Cases:**
- ✅ Selective backups (exclude build artifacts, logs, temp files)
- ✅ Source code transfers (include only source files, exclude dependencies)
- ✅ Clean migrations (exclude platform-specific files)
- ✅ Compliance-aware transfers (exclude sensitive files by pattern)

```bash
# Basic exclude patterns
orbit -s /project -d /backup -R \
  --exclude="*.tmp" \
  --exclude="target/**" \
  --exclude="node_modules/**"

# Include overrides exclude (higher priority)
orbit -s /logs -d /archive -R \
  --include="important.log" \
  --exclude="*.log"

# Use regex for complex patterns
orbit -s /code -d /backup -R \
  --exclude="regex:^tests/.*_test\.rs$" \
  --include="**/*.rs"

# Load filters from file
orbit -s /data -d /backup -R --filter-from=backup.orbitfilter

# Combine with other features
orbit -s /source -d /dest -R \
  --include="*.rs" \
  --exclude="target/**" \
  --check delta \
  --compress zstd:3 \
  --dry-run
```

**Filter File Example (`backup.orbitfilter`):**
```text
# Include source files (higher priority - checked first)
+ **/*.rs
+ **/*.toml
+ **/*.md

# Exclude build artifacts
- target/**
- build/**
- *.o

# Exclude logs and temp files
- *.log
- *.tmp

# Regex for test files
- regex: ^tests/.*_test\.rs$

# Exact path inclusion
include path: Cargo.lock
```

**Pattern Priority:**
1. Include patterns from `--include` (highest)
2. Exclude patterns from `--exclude`
3. Rules from filter file (in file order)
4. Default: Include (if no rules match)

**Example Filter File:** [`examples/filters/example.orbitfilter`](examples/filters/example.orbitfilter)

📖 **Full Documentation:** See [`docs/FILTER_SYSTEM.md`](docs/FILTER_SYSTEM.md)

```bash
# Via CLI flag
orbit copy /source /dest --audit-log ./audit.log

# Via configuration file
audit_format = "json"
audit_log_path = "/var/log/orbit_audit.log"
```

**Example Audit Log (JSON Lines):**
```json
{"timestamp":"2025-10-25T16:42:19Z","job":"orbit-1a2b3c4d-5e6f","source":"/local/data/","destination":"s3://my-bucket/backups/","protocol":"s3","bytes_transferred":104857600,"duration_ms":2341,"compression":"zstd","compression_ratio":2.3,"checksum_algorithm":"blake3","checksum_match":true,"storage_class":"INTELLIGENT_TIERING","multipart_parts":20,"status":"success","retries":0,"starmap_node":"orbit.node.cloud-backup"}
```

**Audit Event Lifecycle:**
1. **started** — Emitted when operation begins (with expected bytes)
2. **progress** — Optional periodic updates during long transfers
3. **success/failure** — Final status with complete metrics

**Audit Features:**
- **JSON Lines format** — One event per line, machine-parseable
- **CSV format** — Alternative format for spreadsheet analysis
- **ISO 8601 timestamps** — With timezone for global deployments
- **Job correlation** — Unique job IDs link related events

## ⚡ Performance Benchmarks

### Local Transfer Performance

| File Size | Traditional cp | Orbit (Zero-Copy) | Speedup | CPU Usage |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-----------|
| 10 MB | 12 ms | 8 ms | 1.5× | ↓ 65% |
| 1 GB | 980 ms | 340 ms | 2.9× | ↓ 78% |
| 10 GB | 9.8 s | 3.4 s | 2.9× | ↓ 80% |

**macOS APFS Optimization**: On APFS filesystems (macOS 10.13+), file copies complete **instantly** via Copy-On-Write cloning — regardless of file size! Data is only duplicated when modified, providing near-zero latency for large files.

### S3 Transfer Performance

- **Multipart Upload:** 500+ MB/s on high-bandwidth links
- **Parallel Operations:** 4-16 concurrent chunks (configurable)
- **Adaptive Chunking:** 5MB-2GB chunks based on file size
- **Resume Efficiency:** Chunk-level verification with intelligent restart decisions

### Compression Performance

- Zstd level 3 → 2.3× faster over networks
- LZ4 → near-realtime local copies
- Adaptive selection based on link speed

---

## 🧠 Smart Strategy Selection

Orbit automatically selects the optimal transfer strategy:

```
Same-disk large file  → Zero-copy (copy_file_range on Linux, APFS cloning on macOS)
macOS APFS            → Instant Copy-On-Write cloning (fclonefileat)
Cross-filesystem      → Streaming with buffer pool
Slow network link     → Compression (zstd/lz4)
Cloud storage (S3)    → Multipart with parallel chunks
Unreliable network    → Smart resume (detect corruption, revalidate)
Critical data         → SHA-256 checksum + audit log
Directory transfers   → Disk Guardian pre-flight checks
```

You can override with explicit flags when needed.

### Configuration

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Control Plane
export ORBIT_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0       # Bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
export ORBIT_SERVER_PORT=8080          # API port (default: 8080)
export ORBIT_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)  # REQUIRED for production
export ORBIT_MAGNETAR_DB=magnetar.db   # Job database path
export ORBIT_USER_DB=users.db          # Auth database path

# Dashboard
# Edit dashboard/.env if needed
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Migration from v1.0 (Nebula)

The v2.2.0 architecture is a complete rewrite. Key changes:

| v1.0 (Nebula) | v2.2.0 (Control Plane) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Leptos SSR | Axum REST API + React SPA |
| `orbit-web` binary | `orbit-server` + separate dashboard |
| Monolithic | Decoupled microservices |
| Server-side rendering | Client-side rendering |
| `cargo leptos watch` | `cargo run` + `npm run dev` |
| `/pkg` WASM assets | Static JSON API |

**Breaking Changes:**
- `orbit serve` now **only** starts the API (no UI bundled)
- Dashboard must be hosted separately or via CDN
- API endpoints remain compatible but are now OpenAPI-documented
- Authentication flow unchanged (JWT cookies)

### Deployment

**Production Checklist:**
- [ ] Set `ORBIT_JWT_SECRET` (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Configure CORS for your dashboard domain
- [ ] Use HTTPS (reverse proxy recommended: nginx/Caddy)
- [ ] Set up persistent volumes for databases
- [ ] Configure firewall rules (allow 8080 for API, 5173 for dev dashboard)
- [ ] Enable request logging (`RUST_LOG=info`)

**Docker Compose Example** (Coming soon)

### Roadmap

- ✅ v2.2.0-alpha.1 - Basic separation, API refactoring, React scaffolding
- 🚧 v2.2.0-alpha.2 - Interactive job creation UI, pipeline visual editor
- 🚧 v2.2.0-beta.1 - Complete dashboard features, duration estimation API
- 🚧 v2.2.0-rc.1 - Production hardening, performance optimization
- 🚧 v2.2.0 - Stable release with full documentation

### Troubleshooting

**Control Plane won't start**
```bash
# Check if port is in use
lsof -i :8080  # Unix
netstat -ano | findstr :8080  # Windows

# Check logs
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin orbit-server
```

**Dashboard can't connect to API**
```bash
# Verify Control Plane is running
curl http://localhost:8080/api/health

# Check CORS configuration in server.rs
# Ensure dashboard origin is allowed
```

**JWT Authentication fails**
```bash
# Ensure JWT_SECRET is set
echo $ORBIT_JWT_SECRET

# Generate a new secret
export ORBIT_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

### Support & Documentation

- 📖 **API Docs**: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui (when running)
- 📁 **Source**: [crates/orbit-web/](crates/orbit-web/) (Control Plane), [dashboard/](dashboard/) (React app)
- 📝 **CHANGELOG**: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md#architecture-shift---orbit-control-plane-v220-alpha-breaking)
- 🐛 **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/saworbit/orbit/issues)

## 🔐 Security

- **Safe Path Handling** — Prevents traversal attacks
- **Checksum Verification** — SHA-256, BLAKE3 for integrity
- **Credential Protection** — Memory scrubbing on drop, no credential logging
- **S3 Encryption** — Server-side encryption (AES-256, AWS KMS)
- **No Telemetry Phone-Home** — All data stays local
- **AWS Credential Chain** — Secure credential sourcing (IAM roles, env vars, credential files)
- **Pre-Flight Validation** — Disk Guardian prevents dangerous operations
- **Future FIPS Support** — Compliance-ready crypto modules

### 🛡️ Dependency Security & Build Features

**Default Build Security:** The default `cargo build` configuration includes **zero runtime security vulnerabilities**. Our minimal feature set (`zero-copy` only) ensures the smallest possible attack surface.

| Build Configuration | Security Status | Use Case |
|---------------------|----------------|----------|
| `cargo build` (default) | ✅ **Zero vulnerabilities** | Production deployments |
| `cargo build --features api` | ✅ **Zero vulnerabilities** | Web dashboard (SQLite only) |
| `cargo build --features smb-native` | ⚠️ **Optional advisory** | SMB protocol (see note below) |
| `cargo build --features full` | ⚠️ **Optional advisory** | Testing & development only |

**Optional Feature Advisory:** When building with `--features smb-native`, a medium-severity timing side-channel advisory (RUSTSEC-2023-0071) is present in the SMB authentication stack. This requires active exploitation during SMB connections and does not affect other protocols or default builds.

**Security Verification:**
```bash
# Verify default build has no active vulnerabilities
cargo tree -p rsa           # Expected: "nothing to print"
cargo tree -p sqlx-mysql    # Expected: "package ID not found"
```

For complete security audit results, dependency chain analysis, and mitigation details, see **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#dependency-security-audit)**.
